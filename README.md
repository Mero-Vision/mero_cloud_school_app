# Work with branches

In this repo the branches are separated into 3 types dev, test and release.DO NOT PUSH INTO RELEASE BRANCH WITHOUT PERMISSION.
The repo is workign with the feature first approach. So, if you are working on a feature, create a new branch from the dev branch and work on it. Once the feature is completed, create a pull request to the dev branch. Once the feature is tested and approved, it will be merged into the test branch. Once the test branch is tested and approved, it will be merged into the release branch.

for new feature on development branch create branch like this:
**dev/feature/feature-name**
